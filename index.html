				Hi, I'm Yun! I was born in Guangzhou, China and was raised in Guangzhou and California. I am a formerly business economics, currently computer science major in my third year at UCLA. <br / ><br / >

				Having only been in the CS field for one year, I am still exploring the different areas within the CS field. Last year, I had the chance to take an IoT class and a graphic design class. Next year, I plan to learn more about machine learning and cycber security. <br / ><br / >

				This summer, I interned in the Avionics Department of Northrop Grumman. I had done projects with friends in Hackathons, but this was my first time feeling how important we are programmers. The codes we programmed are not just lines of words, they hold people's lives, a country's future, the world's future. <br / ><br / >

				My CS journey was not easy, and I would not be the same Yun without all the help I have gotten. Understanding the struggles and the importance of a strong CS community, I become an officer of ACM, ACM-W and UPE, to share my experience, to help people that are going through the same struggle that I have been through, to tighten and strengthen the UCLA CS community. <br / ><br / >

				Thank you for visiting and I hope you enjoy exploring my portfolio! If you are interested in meeting me or working (or going to the gym, or golfing) with me, feel free to explore my work and resume, and reach out to me through any of my social profiles!
